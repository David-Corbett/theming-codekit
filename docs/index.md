# Theming codekit
This repository provides a series of tools and build scripts useful for developing resources that would be used to theme web content:

- write and compile scss to css
- apply appropriate prefixing for css rules
- write and uglify js
- detect features the userâ€™s browser has to offer (via Modernizr)
- code linting
- optimise and compress images for the web
- living style guide for the code via kss

The kit uses [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) and packages to create tooling to perform all of the above. Comprehensive documentation is provided herein on how to use the toolkit and how to configure additional applications should they be needed. The documentation is also online at <https://david-corbett.github.io/theming-codekit/>.
